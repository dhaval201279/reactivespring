/**
 * Cold streams - they represent a  * sequence of data that materialized when we started subscribing to the data. We could
 * subscribe again and get the same data back. The source of data is produced by the act of subscription. The producer of
 * the data is created by the consumer, in this case.
 *
 * Hot streams - A stream is said to be hot when the consumer of the data does not create the producer of the data.
 * when the data stream exists independent of any particular subscriber. A hot stream is more like our notion of a real stream of
 * water: each time you step foot (or, in this case, subscribe to it) into it, youâ€™re stepping into a different
 * stream.
 *
 * This example shows how to use an EmitterProcessor (which are like synchronous Queue<T>s) to
 * publish three items of data. The first subscriber sees the first two elements. The second subscriber
 * subscribes. Then a third item is published, and both the first and the second subscribers see it. The fact
 * that the producer is hot means that the second subscriber observes only the last element, not the first
 * two.
